# Metasploitable2 – Attack & Defense Lab

This repository documents a series of practical attacks and defenses performed
against the intentionally vulnerable **Metasploitable2** machine, using **Kali Linux**
as the attacking host.

The goal of this project is to understand:
- Common vulnerabilities
- Realistic exploitation workflows
- Basic defensive hardening techniques


All experiments were conducted in an isolated lab environment.
